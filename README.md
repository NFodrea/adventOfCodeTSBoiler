# Advent of code 2022

If you want to separate each day into its own node script copy the `day1` in `package.json` abd make a new script for each day pointing to the new files.

If you want to just do you work in one file watch it and update the file each day run `npm run dev`

ESM module imports should be working. Prettier and eslint should also be setup.
